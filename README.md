## JavaScript Calculator 

Designed a beautiful and fully functional JavaScript Calculator, which allows users to add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers. Tested and fixed issues to make sure that the user can not press zeros before any digits except for decimal, the user can clear the input field with a clear button, and keep chaining mathematical operations together until the user hits the equal button, and the calculator will show output with the correct answer.
